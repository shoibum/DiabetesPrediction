Learning Outcomes:
• Linear Regression: We gained insights into linear regression by interpreting coefficients and intercept, providing a base foundation for understanding the relationship between independent and dependent variables.
• K-Nearest Neighbours: We developed an understanding of K-Nearest Neighbours by experimenting with different K values(3, 6, 9). This showed the impact of the choice of neighbours on prediction accuracy and informs model selection in diverse scenarios.
• Model Assessment Proficiency: We also acquired proficiency in model assessment techniques, including interpreting confusion matrices and utilizing accuracy scores to determine and demonstrate which model was better. This is important for evaluating and selecting appropriate machine learning models tailored to specific prediction tasks and projects.
